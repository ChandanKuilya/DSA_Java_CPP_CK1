Characteristics:


Time Complexity:

Best: O(n) (already sorted)

Average/Worst: O(nÂ²)

Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place)

Stable Sort: Yes (preserves the order of equal elements)

Adaptive: Yes (fast if the array is nearly sorted)


###When to Use Insertion Sort?

Small datasets

Partially sorted arrays or nearly sorted arrays

As part of hybrid algorithms (e.g., Java uses Insertion Sort in TimSort for small partitions)


Avoid for:

Large or completely unsorted arrays

Time-critical applications
